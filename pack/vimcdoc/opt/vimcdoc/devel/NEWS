vim 6.4!
<br><br>

and in our first preview release, we already have 60 out of 128 files up-to-date.
Welcome to try it out!
<br><br>
Online HTML versions are also updated for both 6.4 and 7.0 releases. 

0.9.0 released! (19 Mar 2006) by lang2
This is a major milestone release! All Vim documentation are now translated
and updated against Vim 6.4. This release is almost single-handedly made 
possible by Willis, who has only joined us for no more than a month. Everybody
is encouraged to upgrade (hint: read the INSTALL file). Online HTML version will
be updated shortly.

All documents translated (12 Mar 2006) by lang2
Thanks for Willis, we now have a complete translation of all the Vim
documentation, user manual as well as reference manual. Well done Willis. 

0.8.0 is released! (27 Jul 2005) by wandys 
With four new files and many bug fixes.

New mirror! (09 Dec 2004) by lang2
This has been on the table for long. The service on cosoft isn't
half as good as sourceforge. Our Wiki page breaks down from time
to time. Now thanks for wandys, we have a 
<a href="http://vcd.gro.clinux.org">new mirror</a> on gro. Enjoy
it!

vimcdoc 0.7.0 released! (07 July 2004) by lang2
First ever release for Vim 6.3! Loads of changes and improvements.
As usual, see the change log for detail. This release can _NOT_ be
automatically installed for Vim 6.2 or before. Users are suggested
to upgrade to 6.3, or a manual intallation is needed for usage with
previous version of Vim. Sorry. :(. Please read the INSTALL file for
detailed installation instruction.

Hosting slimzhao's user manual PDF (02 July 2004) by lang2
We are honored to host slimzhao's lovely PDF version of the Vim user 
manual. It is of good translation quality, as ours. Download at:
<a href="http://vimcdoc.sourceforge.net/vim_user_manual_603.0.pdf">
<code>http://vimcdoc.sourceforge.net/vim_user_manual_603.0.pdf</code>

Linked by vim homepage. (06.10.2004) by lang2
We are listed by the vim homepage now. Check it out:

vimcdoc 0.6.1 released! (06.01.2004) by lang2
This is mainly a bug fix release. Quite few changes really.
Also, this would be the last vimcdoc release for Vim 6.2
and below.

Wiki page (03.15.2004) by lang2
wandys has put up the wiki page on our cosoft site! It now should be
easier for casual contribution. Simply follow the WiKi link on the left.

vimcdoc 0.6.0 released! (12.30.2003) by lang2
Yet another major release from the hard working vimcdoc team! Three
important pieces were finished: windows.txt, pattern.txt and quickfix.txt.
Enjoy the new release and wish you a very happy new year!

vimcdoc 0.5.0 released! (10.19.2003) by lang2
This is a mile stone release. All the user manual are now reviewed.

Happy Birthday! ^o^ (10.10.2003) by lang2
James He posted in the mailing list:
<blockquote>
It seems that it is one year since our great project started.
Happy Birthday! ^o^ 
</blockquote>
And Here is what lang2 replied.
<blockquote>
:-)
Indeed. I never thought it would take this long to be honest. 
And it is still not finished!
No that has been quite a memorable year.

vimcdoc 0.4.5 released! (10.05.2003) by lang2
Huge amount of updates, including 10 newly translated files and tons
of improvements on the existing ones. See the project page for a full
changelog.

New major release! (09.22.2003) by lang2
Version 0.4.0 is available. See the project page for release note and
change log. Thanks for wandys, dasn and lang2 for the hard work.

New release! 
Version 0.3.5 is available. See the project page for release note and
change log. 

HTML version updated again (08.27.2003) 
We have made some decent progress in the past week or so. The HTML
version is thus updated with the latest! 

2 new members! (08.18.2003) 
We have two new members here, corass and dasn. And dasn has started
working on gui_w32.txt as well as contributing to the reviewing
effort! 

0.3.1 released!!! (06.03.2003) 
This is mainly a bug fix release. Wandys reviewed usr_01.txt through
usr_12.txt and found some obvious defects. 

0.3 released!!! (05.30.2003) 
All user manual files are there and a few other docs. This is a
milestone !!! 

All user manual translated!! (05.29.2003) 
We are on schedule!!! All the user manual documents are now
translated, thanks for wandys and lang2's hard work. Now the release
would be only hours away. The on-line version is updated too. 

Coming closer to the next release (05.19.2003) 
Another bunch of files have been translated by lang2. Now we have only
two and half usr_??.txt files left before I start trying to deliver
the next release. Hopefully it will be before the end of may. 

On-line documents updated again. (03.21.2003) 
The on-line HTML version of the documents are updated. Hopefully this
would be the last time I update them manually. The major change is the
inclusion of usr_41.txt. 

On-line documents updated. (01.24.2003) 
The on-line HTML version of the documents are updated. Not ideal but
they don't change that often either. 

Status update (01.15.2003) 
We've grow to a number of 8 developers now and are making steady
progress. Most of the usr*.txt are translated already.
Our cosoft mirrors are now completely re-worked by wandys. A link from the banner is provided. 

HTML version of documentations on-line (12.05.2002) 
Noticed the link above 'read on-line'? Yes that is it. You can read the
translated documentations on-line now. It isn't great at the moment but
it is usable. Enjoy. 

First ever release (12.02.2002) 
We have 1x files in the CVS already so I believe we should celebrate
this by making the very fist release of vimcdoc project!!!
Also ychimin2000 joined us today and has picked up two files already. 

Web page polished (12.01.2002) 
As you can see, I've simplified the web page. All the useful
information is now at the right hand. A new status page is created as
well. These 2 will do for most of the time I think. I got a bit lazy
during the weekend (partially because of the 2 hr soccer) and found
myself doing these HTML stuff. So there you go, I don't particularly
like the banner and all the colors but don't have time for those. 

Merging... (11.23.2002) 
wandys found out accidentally that Ken (a.k.a nek_in) has already
started a same project long ago on here and managed to translate quite
a few files already. So we mailed the man and basically expressed that
we want to join him. We are now in a process of joining the two
project into one. The main sourceforge site will be used for
developing and the cosoft page will be used for releasing. I'd say
that is a perfect setup. :-) 

CVS ready (11.15.2002) 
As wandys suggested, CVS is now setup and ready to be used. Please go
to the project page for more information on using the repository. A
mailing-list problem has been solved too. So there should be absolutely
no reason for not working hard, ..., except for of course, weekend. 

We've grown (11.14.2002) 
wandys and rmy joined the team. It feels good to be working with
someone instead of fighting all the problems myself. 

Still looking for help (11.13.2002) 
I've I under-estimated the amount of work involved in this project. As
wandys in linuxforum.net said: translation is not easy. I am currently
working on the |quickref.txt| and I can see translation takes a lot of
work. So I need help. Anyone who is interested please feel free to
contact me. Currently I am still on my own. I am hoping to get the
team list growing..... 

web page up (11.12.2002) 
Thanks to the nice people at cosoft.org.cn, I manage to setup the web
page for this project. As you can see now, there isn't much to see
here yet since the project has just begun. The design was 'stolen'
from Open Source Web Design and I'd like to thank warden for creating
this lovely template. 

linuxforum.net is down :( (11.11.2002) 
I initially got quite a number of response from the forum about
starting this project. But I guess I was unlucky to have it only for
one day. The site was down after the day. I've lost contact with most
of the people who has shown interest to the project. Please contact me
if you are one of them. 

files uploaded (11.10.2002) 
I've uploaded two files and put them under release section today. One
of them is a tar ball with all the Vim help documentation from the Vim
6.1 distribution. The other is the current status of the project ;-) -
a partially translated version of the |quickref.txt|. The idea was
just to test how sourceforge releases files. Give it a shot if you
want to. 

project started  (10.10.2002)
It all started with a few post on linuxforum.net talking about editor
people use. The fact that someone was saying those crappy eye candy
editor KDE come up with are better than Vim made me worrying. I said
to my self, 'this is not good for China.' ;-). I am a developer my
self and do a lot of coding. I use Vim only and truly think it is a
great editor. I think people know less about it in China because it is
documented in English. So I've decided to do this project, to promote
Vim as the editor as well as letting more people in China start using
this great tool.
